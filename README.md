# Repository for the Source-Code regarding the CHI 2022 LBW "Accessibility-Related Publication Distribution in HCI Based on a Meta-Analysis"





## Abstract
Accessibility research aims to aid humans that experience minor or major disabilities and conditions. 
However, researchers might have limited exposure to certain disabilities, therefore, focus on those prevalent in their own lives.
This work presents a script-based meta-analysis on addressed populations in accessibility research published on top Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) venues (3617 full papers). 
We categorize the publications regarding the involved people and their disabilities. 
We found that work on vision disability makes up for almost one third (28.85\%) of the work published in general HCI. In light of these findings, we present possible conference- and funding-related explanatory approaches and argue that disability research should more reflect the prevalence of disabilities in the world.
